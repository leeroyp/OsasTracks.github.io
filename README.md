Unit 7: Project 1

Overview:
 This is our first group project where we build our first web application from scratch. We were able to  integrate data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because this was a group project collaborative was required, we learn various  agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

Key Topics

In this project, we worked with node spotify APi.
In order to make requests to the spotify Api, a local serve was created.
A spotiy account is require to make any request to the Api, and we also had to register our app in order to
recieve spotify ID and secret keys
Once we had our  local sever3000 running and connected to the API, using our key we were able to make
various request to the api.
Some of the requests made included "GetMultiple" which was used to search for multiple artist, we were able to
get a response which was an image of particular artist and their and 30 second preview of their popular song
Furthermore we made more requests such as Get similar artist, and Get  playlist
ALl together, this was a fun challengin project that pull all our skills in actions .
