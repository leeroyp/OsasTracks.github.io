Unit 7: Project 1

Overview:
 This is our first group project where we build our first web application from scratch. 
 
 Node is require to run this webpage. 
 
 In order to run this application, you will need to get access via localhost3000
 
 We were able to  integrate data received from multiple server-side API requests. 
 
 This was a group project collaboration was required, we learnt various agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

In this project, we worked with node spotify APi.

In order to make requests to the spotify API, a local server was created.

A spotify account was require to make any request to the API, and we also had to register our app in order to
recieve spotify ID and secret keys.

Once we had our  local server3000 running and connected to the API, using our key we were able to make
various requests to the API.

Some of the requests made included "GetMultiple" which was used to search for multiple artist, we were able to
get a response which was an image of a particular artist along with a 30 second preview of their popular song

Furthermore we made more requests such as Get similar artist, and Get  playlist.

Altogether, this was a fun challenging project that put all our skills in actions.
